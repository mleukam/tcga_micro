2/3/2020 Lab Meeting Notes:

- Create boxes for separate models, pass list structure in, and eventually collapse all the results from all the models with tweaked settings to be displayed in a single diagram
- Use multiple batch correction models and compare (HM? DeSEQ2?)
- Pick 2-3 cancers:
    = How do I normalize?
    = How do I batch correct?
    = Which features am I using?
    = Which modeling system am I using?
    
Look at outputs for expected or easily interpretable results to assess performance of the model.
