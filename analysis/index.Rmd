Analysis of TCGA data using Agamemnon

## Data prep

Read in data from Agememnon output. Supplement with clinical data from GDC and 
immune correlates table provided by Nelly. Organize with listed nest structure
and save for easy later access.

* [Collect Tables](collect_tables.html) - get individual results from Agamemnon into a single table for eeach project (run on O2). Repair taxonomy with no missing taxa.
* [TCGA Data Prep](tcga_data_prep.html) - change rownames to TCGA legacy barcodes. Get full TCGA barcodes for batch correction. Add in clinical and immune correlate data. Save output in list structure. Filter cases for primary tumors only and eliminate second biopsies from cases with multiple tissue biopsies.
* [Derive Variables](derive_vars.html) - calculate measures of diversity, richness, high level taxonomy, and other basic descriptive summary variables for later analysis.
* [Batch Correction](batch_correction.Rmd) - log transformation, normalization, and batch correction by sequencing center and plate using limma model.

## Immune correlates

* [Calculate immune correlations for genera](genus_models.html)
